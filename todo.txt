1. a logger for easy logging
2. fps & and other debug info
3. extremely simple classes like Player that I can stub off of in future projects and implement in different ways
	and since its modular I should be able to export and easily replace the player 
4. an extremely simple playformer or something that works with these simple classes. 
5. fix the terminal so it adjusts to different screen sizes
