1. a logger for easy logging
2. a cheat console for a testing games. calls funcs, etc
3. fps & and other debug info
4. extremely simple classes like Player that I can stub off of in future projects and implement in different ways
	and since its modular I should be able to export and easily replace the player 
5. an extremely simple playformer or something that works with these simple classes.
