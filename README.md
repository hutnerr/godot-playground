## Overview
This is a place for me to experiment, learn, and create modular Godot solutions in isolation. The idea is:
1. Select a topic to research and learn about
2. Code it up, use it, experiment with it
3. Review and polish it until I'm happy with it
4. Add it to my Godot toolbox

## Playground Features
Below are some features that were created to better enable the idea of the playground and facilitate the experiements.

1. Developer Terminal which allows for specifiying a command set. Useful to prevent clutter and specified commands based on current work. 
2. Performance testing scripts.
3. Debug window with relevant statistics such as FPS.
